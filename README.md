## Blink-attiny
Simple blink sketch for attiny (contains also some notes on how to setup arduino IDE for programming attiny using arduino as ISP)
## soundbar-IR
This will send IR codes (POWER TOGGLE, MODE TOGGLE, MODE TOGGLE gets it in BT mode) to my soundbar when the mains power is turned on.
I hacked the soundbar to get the 5V from the main circuit board
